# Novastorm

**Ambient Development toolkit — development that happens around you while you use your app.**

[![License: BSL 1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSL%201.1-green)](LICENSE.md)

Novastorm observes how you use your application and builds features across the full stack — from UI to database — based on your behavior, voice commands, and visual cues. No IDE switching. No context loss. You stay in your product.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @novastorm-ai/cli

# Setup AI provider
nova setup

# Start in your project directory
cd my-project
nova
```

Nova auto-detects your stack, starts the dev server, and opens the browser with the overlay.

## The Problem

AI coding tools accelerate one step: turning a description into code. But writing code was never the real bottleneck — it's only 25-35% of the path from idea to production.

Every existing approach requires you to **stop using your product and start describing** what you want.

Novastorm removes that step entirely. You don't describe. You **use**. The system observes and builds.

```
nova bible --read    # Read the Ambient Development manifesto
```

## How It Works

```
You use your app → Nova observes → classifies the task → generates full-stack changes → hot reload
```

Three simultaneous modes:

- **Passive** — watches your behavior, spots patterns, suggests improvements
- **Voice** — speak instructions without leaving your app: *"Add a CSV export button here"*
- **Visual** — click elements, draw areas, point at what needs to change

### Speed Lanes

| Lane | Time | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| Instant | < 2s | CSS, text, colors, spacing |
| Fast | 10-30s | Single-file changes, new component |
| Thorough | 1-5 min | Multi-file features, new pages + API + DB |
| Background | minutes-hours | Refactoring, migrations, optimization |

### Supported Stacks

Novastorm is stack-agnostic. It scans your project and adapts:

- Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, Astro
- Express, Django, FastAPI, .NET, Rails, Go
- Any combination: *"Next.js + C# backend"* — works

### AI Providers

```bash
nova setup
```

- **Claude CLI** — free with Claude Max/Pro subscription
- **OpenRouter** — pay-per-token
- **Ollama** — completely free, runs locally

## Usage

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Give instruction | Type in overlay input bar + Enter |
| Voice command | Mic button → speak → mic button |
| Edit one element | `Option+I` → click → type → Enter |
| Edit multiple | `Option+K` → click elements → type → Enter |
| Confirm tasks | `Y` in terminal or Execute button |
| Undo last change | Type `undo` in terminal |
| Open project map | `Option+M` |
| Read the manifesto | `nova bible --read` |
